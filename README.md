  This project implements a patient care analysis system based on the provided flow diagram, including synthetic data generation, data preprocessing, model training, semantic network, RL model, NLP summarization, backend, frontend, and deployment.

  ## Prerequisites
  - Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
  - Node.js and npm (for local frontend development, optional).

  ## Project Structure
  - `backend/`: FastAPI backend with Random Forest model, mock semantic network, RL, and NLP summarization.
  - `frontend/`: React frontend to display results.
  - `Dockerfile`: Dockerfile for the backend.
  - `frontend/Dockerfile`: Dockerfile for the frontend.
  - `docker-compose.yml`: Docker Compose configuration to run both services.

  ## Setup and Running the Project

  1. **Clone the Repository** (or create the project structure manually):
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     cd patient-care-analysis
     ```

  2. **Build and Run with Docker Compose**:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up --build
     ```
     - This will build and start both the backend (FastAPI) and frontend (React) services.
     - The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.
     - The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

  3. **Access the Application**:
     - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
     - You'll see a form to input symptoms (checkboxes for chills, sweating, headache, body aches, fatigue, and loss of appetite).
     - Check the symptoms and click "Predict Diagnosis" to see the results, including the predicted diagnosis, next steps, medical report, and simplified summary.

  ## Notes
  - **Backend**: The backend uses a Random Forest model for prediction, a mock semantic network (Neo4j), a mock RL (DQN) model, and a mock NLP summarization (Hugging Face). In a real implementation, you would need to set up Neo4j, train a DQN model, and integrate a Hugging Face model for summarization.
  - **Frontend**: The React app is minimal and displays the results in a clean, styled format consistent with the PCAP design.
  - **Deployment**: The project is containerized using Docker. You can deploy it to a cloud provider like Google Cloud Run by pushing the Docker images to a container registry and deploying them.

  ## Troubleshooting
  - If the frontend cannot connect to the backend, ensure the backend is running and accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.
  - If you encounter Docker issues, ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running.

  ## Future Improvements
  - Integrate a real Neo4j database for the semantic network.
  - Train a DQN model for RL-based next-step prediction.
  - Add a real Hugging Face model for NLP summarization in the backend.
  - Enhance the frontend with more features (e.g., patient history, doctor recommendations).
